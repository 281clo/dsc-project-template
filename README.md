# Animal Center Needs Analysis
### Alison Peebles Madigan, alison.peeblesmadigan@flatironschool.com

Austin, Texas is committed to serving the needs of animals in the city, operating as the largest [No Kill community](https://bestfriends.org/2025-goal/what-no-kill-really-means) in the nation. The Austin Animal Center is central to this effort, sheltering more than 16,000 animals each year, offering animal protection, and providing pet resource services to all of Austin and Travis County.

## Business Problem

This project aims to improve the operational efficiency of the Austin Animal Center in two ways.

- Identify animals that are likely to have extended stays and would benefit a PR campaign to promote adoption.
- Identify seasonal resource needs to better plan, purchase and hire. 

## Data

The Austin Animal Center has the longest running public dataset of animal rescues in the country. Every animal has a unique id that ties to both their intake and outcome data when they enter and leave the shelter.
