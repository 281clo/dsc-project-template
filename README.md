# Phase 1 Project Template - Above and Beyond (AAB)

This version of the repository template builds upon the MVP version. It incorporates best practices for project organization and code modularization.

## Repository Contents

- `README.md`: The README for this repo branch explaining it's contents - you're reading it now
   - This does not belong in your project - instructions for deleting it are below
- `TEMPLATE_README.md`: An example of a README for your project
  - This is a brief overview of your whole project
- `dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb`: A starter Jupyter Notebook
  - Inside the notebook, there is some text and guiding questions within lined sections that you should answer in narrative form
  - Includes sample visualizations - the code to create them is in the `visualizations.py` file
- `__init__.py`: Python helper file that tells Python that there are packages in the repository that can be imported
- `DS_Project_Presentation_Template.pdf`: A starter slide deck
  - PDF of a sample slide deck to use for a presentation to your class or an employer
  - Here is an [online editable version](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PaiH1bleXnhiPjTPsAXQSiAK0nkaRlseQIr_Yb-0mz0/copy) of the presentation - instructions for using this are below.
- `code` folder:
  - `__init__.py`: Python helper file that tells Python that there are packages in the repository that can be imported
  - `data_cleaning.py`: Sample script to clean data and prepare it for analysis and visualization
  - `visualizations.py`: Sample script to produce visualizations
  - You may also find it helpful to have a Jupyter Notebook here for messy EDA or data preparation
- `data` folder:
  - Contains data referenced in Jupyter Notebook code cells
- `images` folder:
  - Contains images referenced in Jupyter Notebook markdown cells
- `.gitignore` file that tells git to not track certain files and folders

***
## Notes

- The code within `visualizations.py` and `data_cleaning.py` are examples of well-documented code.
