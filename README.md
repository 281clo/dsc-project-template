# Phase 1 Project Templates and Examples

This repo contains templates and examples to help you get started with your Phase 1 Project. Each of these is in a separate branch, as follows:

- The **template-mvp** branch is the template you should use to start your project to create your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- The **example-mvp** branch is an example project using the MVP template.
- The **template-aab** branch is the template you should use to improve your project after you've finished your MVP, to go Above and Beyond (AAB).
- The **example-aab** branch is an example project using the AAB template.
